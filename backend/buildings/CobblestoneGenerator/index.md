The **Cobblestone Generator** is an automated cobblestone production system designed for efficient resource generation.

![Front View](exterior.jpg)

It was originally constructed to provide **steady cobblestone supply** for large construction projects.  
The design uses lava and water flows with automated collection systems for continuous operation.

The heart of the system features precise timing mechanisms where all redstone circuitry controls the flow cycles.

With an optimized design, the generator produces over 1000 cobblestone blocks per hour.
