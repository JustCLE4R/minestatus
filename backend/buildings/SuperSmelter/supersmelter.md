The **Super Smelter** is an industrial-scale smelting system designed for bulk ore processing.

It was originally constructed to handle **massive throughput** from the quarry.  
The design allows 32 furnaces to work simultaneously using hopper minecarts for even distribution.

The heart of the system is located behind the main control panel, where all redstone circuitry is neatly hidden.

With an optimized layout, the smelter completes a full load in under 2 minutes.
